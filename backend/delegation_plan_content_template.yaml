# Optimized Delegation Plan for Content Template
# Topic Researcher and Content Strategist run in PARALLEL
# Senior Writer waits for BOTH before starting

tasks:
  # PARALLEL TASKS - Both start immediately
  - task_key: topic_researcher_task
    async_execution: true
    dependencies: []
    # Gathers factual material independently

  - task_key: content_strategist_task
    async_execution: true
    dependencies: []
    # Designs content structure independently

  # FINAL TASK - Waits for both parallel tasks
  - task_key: senior_writer_task
    async_execution: false
    dependencies: [topic_researcher_task, content_strategist_task]
    # Needs research findings AND content strategy

# Performance:
# - Researcher and Strategist work simultaneously (50% time savings)
# - Writer has both inputs ready when they start
# - Total time: max(research_time, strategy_time) + writing_time
# - Instead of: research_time + strategy_time + writing_time
