# Optimized Delegation Plan for Development Template
# Requirements Analyst and Technical Researcher run in PARALLEL
# System Designer waits for BOTH
# Lead Developer waits for System Designer

tasks:
  # PARALLEL PHASE - Both start immediately
  - task_key: requirements_analyst_task
    async_execution: true
    dependencies: []
    # Analyzes user requirements independently

  - task_key: technical_researcher_task
    async_execution: true
    dependencies: []
    # Researches technology stack independently

  # DESIGN PHASE - Waits for both parallel tasks
  - task_key: system_designer_task
    async_execution: false
    dependencies: [requirements_analyst_task, technical_researcher_task]
    # Needs requirements AND tech stack to design architecture

  # IMPLEMENTATION PHASE - Waits for design
  - task_key: lead_developer_task
    async_execution: false
    dependencies: [system_designer_task]
    # Needs complete architecture design to implement

# Performance:
# Time: max(requirements, tech_research) + design + development
# vs Sequential: requirements + tech_research + design + development
# Savings: One full task duration (~25% faster)
