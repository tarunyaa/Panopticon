# Optimized Delegation Plan for Research Template
# Primary Researcher and Critical Analyst run in PARALLEL
# Report Synthesizer waits for BOTH

tasks:
  # PARALLEL PHASE - Both start immediately
  - task_key: primary_researcher_task
    async_execution: true
    dependencies: []
    # Gathers authoritative data independently

  - task_key: critical_analyst_task
    async_execution: true
    dependencies: []
    # Analyzes perspectives and biases independently

  # SYNTHESIS PHASE - Waits for both parallel tasks
  - task_key: report_synthesizer_task
    async_execution: false
    dependencies: [primary_researcher_task, critical_analyst_task]
    # Needs research data AND critical analysis

# Performance:
# Time: max(primary_research, critical_analysis) + synthesis
# vs Sequential: primary_research + critical_analysis + synthesis
# Savings: One full task duration (~33% faster)
